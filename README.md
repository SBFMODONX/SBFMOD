## What Is YuGiOhGotchi?

**YuGiOhGotchi** is an experimental on-chain project built on Solana.

It brings **:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}–style card rules** into a live, automated system where **rules themselves become the duelists**.

There are no players controlling cards.  
There are no manual actions.

Instead, each YuGiOhGotchi runs its own independent card rule system on-chain, and all outcomes are resolved automatically.

---

## Core Idea

Traditional card games are driven by players.

YuGiOhGotchi explores a different question:

> **What happens when duels are no longer controlled by humans, but by rules themselves?**

In YuGiOhGotchi:
- Rules are drawn by the system
- Rules are executed automatically
- Outcomes cannot be reversed

Humans do not play.  
Humans observe.

---

## How It Works

### 1. Independent Rule Systems

Each YuGiOhGotchi operates with its own card rule system.

- Rules are **not chosen by users**
- Rules are **not selected by the team**
- Rules are **drawn automatically by the system**

Once a rule is drawn, it must be executed.  
There is no undo and no rollback.

---

### 2. No Player Control

YuGiOhGotchi is **not a player-versus-player game**.

- No buttons to press  
- No strategies to input  
- No actions to perform  

There is no way to influence the outcome of a duel.

The system itself becomes the duelist.

---

### 3. Live Duels via Pumpfun

When two YuGiOhGotchi connect through **Pumpfun livestream linking**, a duel begins automatically.

During the livestream:
- Both sides draw rules in real time
- Rule interactions are resolved automatically
- Results are determined by predefined priorities

The livestream simply shows what happens when **two rule systems collide**.

This marks the **first time Pumpfun livestream connections are used for live, system-level card duels**.

---

## What YuGiOhGotchi Is Not

YuGiOhGotchi is **not**:

- A traditional card game  
- A player-controlled game  
- A play-to-earn system  
- An NFT adoption or ownership game  

There are no players, no progression systems, and no rewards for winning.

---

## Why Pumpfun?

Pumpfun provides a unique environment where:
- Attention is live
- Events happen in public
- Outcomes are witnessed together

YuGiOhGotchi uses Pumpfun livestream connections as the **stage**, not as a control layer.

Duels happen live.  
Results unfold in public.

---

## Philosophy

YuGiOhGotchi is a **rule experiment**, not a competitive game.

It explores:
- Automation over control
- Rules over players
- Observation over interaction

The goal is not to win —  
the goal is to **see what happens**.

---

## Status

YuGiOhGotchi is an ongoing experimental project.

Features, rules, and formats may evolve over time, but the core idea remains unchanged:

> **Rules are drawn. Outcomes remain.**

---

## Disclaimer

YuGiOhGotchi is an experimental on-chain system with no guaranteed utility, value, or financial return.

It exists as a public exploration of automated rule systems, live interactions, and on-chain experiments.

Participation is voluntary and observational.
