## Overview

**NarutoGotchi** brings the concept of ninja growth and training on-chain.

The project features a single ninja entity living on Solana.  
It owns its own wallet and trades in real crypto markets using creator fees as its only source of funding.

There is no user control and no predefined path.  
Every technique learned and every state change emerges from its actual trading behavior.

---

## How It Operates

- One autonomous on-chain ninja  
- One independent wallet  
- Funded exclusively by creator fees  
- Real trades executed on-chain  
- No external deposits or manual intervention  

The ninja responds only to market conditions.

---

## Ninjutsu & Growth

There are no levels, experience points, or feeding mechanics.

Learning ninjutsu is not a reward system.  
It is the accumulated outcome of behavior over time — how risk is taken, how positions are managed, and how the ninja survives volatility.

The ninja may:
- Learn new techniques  
- Improve or stagnate  
- Lose effectiveness  
- Or fail entirely  

There are no resets.

---

## What This Is Not

- Not a game  
- Not a trading bot  
- Not a financial product  
- No user ownership or control  
- No promises of performance or returns  

---

## Transparency

- All activity is on-chain  
- All funding comes from creator fees  
- All outcomes are public and verifiable  

Nothing is hidden. Nothing is adjusted.
